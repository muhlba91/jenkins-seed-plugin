package acceptance
/**
 * Sample pipeline generation, used for acceptance tests.
 *
 * It uses an additional environment variable: BRANCH_PARAM
 *
 * The Seed plug-in will give the following parameters to this scripts, available directly as variables:
 *
 * - raw parameters (seed generator input + scm branch)
 *   - PROJECT - raw project name, like nemerosa/seed in GitHub
 *   - PROJECT_CLASS
 *   - PROJECT_SCM_TYPE
 *   - PROJECT_SCM_URL
 *   - BRANCH - basic branch name in the SCM
 *
 * - computed parameters:
 *   - SEED_PROJECT: project normalised name
 *   - SEED_BRANCH: branch normalised name
 *
 * The jobs are generated directly at the level of the branch seed job, so no folder needs to be created for the
 * branch itself.
